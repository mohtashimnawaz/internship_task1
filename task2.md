üìù Short Report: Technical Comparison of Blockchain Platforms

The three platforms‚ÄîEthereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and R3 Corda‚Äîoffer distinct capabilities tailored for different operational scenarios.

Ethereum, as a public blockchain, emphasizes openness and decentralization. It supports Turing-complete smart contracts via Solidity and Vyper and has a large global node base. Its major limitation lies in lower throughput (~30 TPS) and relatively high latency, though rollups and Layer 2 solutions address scalability challenges.

Hyperledger Fabric excels in private enterprise scenarios. Its permissioned model offers high throughput (~3,000 TPS) and fine-grained control over access through private channels. Smart contracts (called Chaincode) are supported in mainstream languages like Go and Java, but Fabric lacks a native token, limiting decentralized economic incentives.

R3 Corda is consortium-focused, designed for financial institutions needing privacy. It uses point-to-point messaging rather than global broadcast, ensuring transaction confidentiality. With limited throughput (~170 TPS), Corda does not support native tokens but allows custom asset representation, ideal for secure inter-bank or trade operations.

Platform Choices:
Decentralized App: Ethereum‚Äîbest for open, global, censorship-resistant applications.
Supply Chain Network (Known Partners): Hyperledger Fabric‚Äîideal due to private channels and high TPS.
Inter-Bank Financial Application: R3 Corda‚Äîtailored for privacy, regulated environments, and complex financial workflows.
Each selection aligns with the platform‚Äôs architectural strengths and intended enterprise or public use case.
